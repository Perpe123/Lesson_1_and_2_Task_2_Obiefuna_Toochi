                <p>
                    Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterised by
                    elevated levels of blood glucose which leads over time to
                    damage to the heart, blood vessels, kidney, eye and nerves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Diabetes can be type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas
                    produces little or no insulin or type 2 in which the body's
                    ability to utilize available insulin is impaired leading to
                    inability to process sugar.

                <p>
                    This is a condition characterized by an elevated level of
                    glucose in the blood during pregnancy, typically resolving
                    after the birth of the child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Routine blood glucose monitoring and monitoring of the baby
                    are highly recommended. Regular physical exercise, weight
                    reduction and consumption of healthy diet are also
                    beneficial in such condition.

                Omega-3 fatty acids are essential and can only be obtained from
                the diet. This Omega-3 dietary deficiency is compounded by the
                fact that pregnant women become depleted in Omega-3s because the
                fetus uses Omega-3s for its nervous system deployment. It has a
                number of benefits which includes:

                        DHA supplementation during pregnancy may positively
